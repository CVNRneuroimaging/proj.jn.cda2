# Nocera CDA2 data notes, Wednesday 20150923, stowler

_Includes 3.5 h overtime: 7p-10:30p_

_Note for VA timekeeping audits: No new images were produced during this OT period. Work during this OT session was captured in the notes below, the script `00.projectEnvironment.sh` (linked below), and a related email discussion with Joe that continued through 10:30p and into next day (subject: "For your Nov analysis: omit pre sessions that don't have a matching post, right?")_

# Prepared code for working with subsets of sessions

Upcoming group analyses need to address specific subsets of sessions, but current scripts do their work across all sessions per wildcards (`ls -d /data/panolocal/processedOnPano-nocera/derivedData/cda*`). To prepare for group analyses I initiated a script to export session lists as environmental variables for use by other scripts: [`00.projectEnvironment.sh`](https://github.com/CVNRneuroimaging/proj.jn.cda2/blob/master/00.projectEnvironment.sh). "Atypical" sessions that have acquisition or processing abnormalities are noted in the comments, and typical sessions are included in variables:

```bash
sessionsTypicalExercisePre
sessionsTypicalExercisePst
sessionsTypicalExercise

sessionsTypicalControlPre
sessionsTypicalControlPst
sessionsTypicalControl

sessionsTypical
```



# Constructed session lists: 2015Nov exercise pre and post

Cross-checked my QC notes, Nocera meeting notes, Nocera spreadsheets, and our DICOM store to produce a list of sessions to be included in Joe's 2015Nov group analyses of exercise pre and exercise post.

For scripting I captured these session lists in [`00.projectEnvironment.sh`](https://github.com/CVNRneuroimaging/proj.jn.cda2/blob/master/00.projectEnvironment.sh):

```bash
#######################################################################
# Lists of sessions for 2015Nov analysis. Each session must include:
#     1 anat
#     6 fmri taskCMG
#
# Particicipants only included if they have pre- and post-treatment sessions.

# Excercise sessions will include cda004pst, which is only atypical because it
# is missing RSFMRI, which isn't relevant for 2015Nov analysis:
export sessions2015NovExercisePst="${sessionsTypicalExercisePst} cda004pst"
export sessions2015NovExercisePre="`echo ${sessions2015NovExercisePst} | sed 's/pst/pre/g'`"
export sessions2015NovExercise="${sessions2015NovExercisePre} ${sessions2015NovExercisePst}"
```

Emailed Joe for confirmation:

>Hi Joe. I just want to double-check a group construction issue for the Nov group ICA we discussed. You're asking for pre vs post within each participant group, so I'm assuming you want to omit any pre-treatment scans that don't have matching post-treatment scans, right? -Stephen

...and

>Great. So by my count that's nine participants: cda001-cda010, but not cda009 who discontinued. So now I'm just obsessively double-checking with you: any other exercisers get post scans that I just don't know about yet? (I don't see any on telomere).


(NB: later Joe notes that cda006 should be moved to control group despite being in the cda0XX numbering. He also mistakenly had cda011pst on his list, which has three runs instead of six. TBD: make sure cda011 doesn't accidentally appear on future lists.)




# Manually inspected exercise pre and post images

In preparation for upcoming group ICA I performed a manual final inspection of images for the pre and post sessions above, including anat, QC, and ICA/FIX output. I did not find any missing files or processing errors that would disqualify any sessions on those lists.
