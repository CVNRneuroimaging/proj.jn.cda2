# Nocera CDA2 data notes, Friday 20150911, stowler

_Includes overtime: 8p-10p_


Contents
=================

# inspected registrations

Inspected registrations. Could definitely benefit from adding nonlinear registration to MELODIC. TBD.

# script renaming

Renamed scripts to be be consistent with Hackney, dropping study-specific nomenclature where possible so that we can generalize.

# backed up rama to pano

Backed up rama to pano, after which pano's entire `/data/panolocal` will get backed up to hippoback.

```bash
[21:49:43]-[stowler-local]-at-[pano]-in-[/data/panolocal/processedOnPano-nocera]
$ rsync -vr --progress stowler-local@rama.birc.emory.edu:/data/panolocal/processedOnPano-nocera/derivedData .
