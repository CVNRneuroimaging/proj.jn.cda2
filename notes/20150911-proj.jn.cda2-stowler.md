# inspected registrations

Inspected registrations. Could definitely benefit from adding nonlinear registration to MELODIC. TBD.

# script renaming

Renamed scripts to be be consistent with Hackney, dropping study-specific nomenclature where possible so that we can generalize.

# backed up rama to pano

Backed up rama to pano, after which pano's entire `/data/panolocal` will get backed up to hippoback.
