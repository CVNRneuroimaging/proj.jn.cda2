# Migrated scripts from macs

Migrated more scripts from encrypted macs with out-of-date directory structure to pano/rama's up-to-date directory structure. Also added to github repo for portability, visibility, and revision tracking:

- `07.noceraMelodic-rest-generateFsfVariants.sh`

# Tested migrated scripts

_Executed migrated scripts on pano/rama to create output that is consistent with current directory structures._

## melodic .fsf files for fmri rest

Per-session MELODIC .fsf config files for fmri resting state were adapted to be compatible with current pano/rama directory structure.

Relaunched, but with nonlinear registration turned on:

Inspected result by rsync'ing for off-line inspection. Registration didn't really improve, and will definitely require additional work. Could be an interaction with this single test participant. TBD.
