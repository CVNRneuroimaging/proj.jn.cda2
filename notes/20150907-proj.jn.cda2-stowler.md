_Labor day. So it's all overtime, though Lisa says labeling on mypay may be strange because it's a holiday._

# Started notes directory

Started `notes` directory in github repo, in which I'll keep daily "lab notebook"-style notes like this one. Though plenty of process metadata is captured by git commits, I need a way to record what operations are performed on which hosts, and to create a record of transfers between hosts.

# Encrypted sensitive scripts

Encrypted `00.renameDicomStoreExports-dicomDirSessions.sh` and committed to github repo instead of relying on ad-hoc sync across encrypted hosts approved for sensitive data. Documented for README.md:

>As part of PHI/PII removal, the script `00.renameDicomStoreExports-dicomDirSessions.sh` renames session directories that have been exported from the PHI/PII-encumbered DICOM store. The session-level directory names exported from the DICOM store are *expected* to contain acquisition dates because of the way DICOMs are stored in the PHI/PII-encumbered DICOM store. When that is true, this anonymizing script becomes encumbered by a record of the renaming operation: it links the anonymous session ID with its acquisition date (e.g. `mv cda001_20120325 cda001pre`).
  
>Therefore this script is stored encrypted by AES256 with high-entropy password, and only decrypted for editing and execution on hosts approved for sensitive data.

>Encryption:
```bash
$ gpg \
--cipher-algo AES256 \
--armor \
--symmetric \
00.renameDicomStoreExports-dicomDirSessions.sh
```

>Decryption:
```bash
$ gpg \
-o 00.renameDicomStoreExports-dicomDirSessions.sh \
--decrypt \
00.renameDicomStoreExports-dicomDirSessions.sh.asc
```

# Migrated scripts from macs

Migrated more scripts from encrypted macs with out-of-date directory structure to pano/rama's up-to-date directory structure. Also added to github repo for portability, visibility, and revision tracking:

- `03.1.noceraQcTaskCMG-singleSession.sh`
- `03.2.noceraQcTaskCMG-parallelSessions.sh`
- `04.1.noceraQcRest-singleSession.sh`
- `04.2.noceraQcRest-parallelSessions.sh`

# Tested migrated scripts

_Executed migrated scripts on pano/rama to create output that is consistent with current directory structures. Backed up results to hippoback._

## passed: QC for fmri task CMG

Scripts were adapted to be compatible with current pano/rama directory structure, and also to run QC from non-sensitive nii files (FSL MNI orientation) instead of from DICOMs.

TBD: spot-checks to compare these QC results to QC results generated from original DICOMs.

```bash

## passed: QC for fmri resting

Scripts were adapted to be compatible with current pano/rama directory structure, and also to run QC from non-sensitive nii files (FSL MNI orientation) instead of from DICOMs.

TBD: spot-checks to compare these QC results to QC results generated from original DICOMs.
