# Nocera CDA2 data notes, Thursday 20150924, stowler

# Received confirmation of exercise group construction:

Joe confirmed by email that analysis of his 2015Nov exercise group is going to exclude cda011 because post session only has three runs. My response confirming group membership:

>Got it. So we're looking at exercise group w/ n=8 unless you decide you want to slip in cda012 at the last minute:

>cda001pre cda002pre cda003pre cda004pre cda005pre cda007pre cda008pre cda010pre 
>cda001pst cda002pst cda003pst cda004pst cda005pst cda007pst cda008pst cda010pst 

>It's worth noting that this n=8 only works because you are omitting resting state analysis for November. In designs that include RSFMRI you'll be down to n=7 because cda004pst opted out of RSFMRI.


# FIX for taskCMG: melodicFixWhII_Standard20-gnuParallel10.ica

These FIX batch completed in about 4 hours, but zabbix plots show that there was an unusual, unexplained pause in CPU and RAM utilization between ~16:53 and ~17:13. TBD: delete and re-run.
