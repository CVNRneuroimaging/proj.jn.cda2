# Migrated scripts from macs

Migrated more scripts from encrypted macs with out-of-date directory structure to pano/rama's up-to-date directory structure. Also added to github repo for portability, visibility, and revision tracking:

- `08.1.noceraFix-singleRun.sh`
- `08.2.noceraFix-taskCMG-parallelRuns.sh`

# Tested migrated scripts

_Executed migrated scripts on pano/rama to create output that is consistent with current directory structures. Backed up results to hippoback._

## fsl fix for fmri taskCMG 

Scripts were adapted to be compatible with current pano/rama directory structure.
